This project demonstrates OCR (Optical Character Recognition) using three popular libraries: PyTesseract, Keras-OCR, and EasyOCR. Each library extracts text from images to showcase their capabilities. PyTesseract leverages Tesseract's engine for simple OCR tasks, Keras-OCR uses deep learning pipelines for robust text detection and recognition, and EasyOCR provides multilingual support with an easy-to-use API.
